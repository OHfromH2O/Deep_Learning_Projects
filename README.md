> **Context:** This repository documents my self-directed learning journey in Deep Learning. It contains practical implementations, code exercises, and mini-projects derived from professional certifications, technical literature, and Kaggle competitions.

## 🎯 Objective
To bridge the gap between **Wet-Lab Biology** and **Computational Intelligence**.
My goal is to master the implementation of Neural Networks (CNNs, RNNs) and apply them to biological datasets such as genomic sequences and medical imaging.
